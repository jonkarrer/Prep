## Roadmap

- [] Meal plans page
  - [] auto generate meal plans based on like ingredients and exclude desserts for up to 5 days - allow user to create their own meal plans
- [] Pantry page
  - [] use ingredients in db as the pantry list and then allow users to select "in stock" or "out of stock" and then auto generate a shopping list for them as well as let them make their own.
